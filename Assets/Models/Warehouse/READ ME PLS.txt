set the mesh texture mechbase to cutout in unity to make holes see through, should work

all the parts to this are seperate theyre just in one prefab

it should be scaled to right size, but blender scale might be different to unity so

the entire room should be approx 30m X 30m X 9m

i left the doorways open instead of putting stuff in the way cus i dunno if you wanted that, just put invisiwalls or make the player insta die if they go in i dunno shruggie

sorreh for messy texture names n folder 

fangz 2 raven for the halp, stop flamin ok
