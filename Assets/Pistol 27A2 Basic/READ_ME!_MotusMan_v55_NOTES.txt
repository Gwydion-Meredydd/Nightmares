NOTES: MotusMan_v55

"MotusMan_v55.fbx" is a different modified skeleton from the older MotusMan_v4. They are very similar but not the same.

Animations from older packs with MotusMan_v4 will not load properly onto the newer MotusMan_v55, so they will still need to use the MotusMan_v4 as the source for retargeting.


Our newer FBX animation packs are created with MotusMan_v55, so it is the base and source skeleton for all included animations.
